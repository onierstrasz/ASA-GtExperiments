Entities are:
- A Garage Door
- A remote control
- A car
- A Sensor

A garage door can be in one of the following states:

Open
Closed
Opening
Closing
Stopped (while opening)
Stopped (while closing).

The door changes state when it receives a signal from the remote, or from a sensor.

In this example we can describe the m2 entities, and a concrete m1 scenario.
